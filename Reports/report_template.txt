[SentiSteem report #<REPORT_COUNT>] Twitter analysis of word "<KEYWORD>" between <TWEETS_SINCE> and <TWEETS_TO>
<center>-------------------LINECHART---------------------------------------</center>
<b><i>Hello world!</i>  Welcome to report where I'm using machine learning to analyze tweets about specified topic and present results in form of various and easy to understand charts. The sentiment analysis algorithm has been developed as part of my Master Thesis in 2017/2018. </b>

<h3>Parameters</h3>Today's analysis has been executed on tweets which contain word <b>"<KEYWORD>"</b> and were published <b>between <TWEETS_SINCE> and <TWEETS_TO></b>. Detailed specification of the data is shown in the following list:
<ul>
<li><b>Keyword:</b> <KEYWORD></li>
<li><b>From:</b> <TWEETS_SINCE></li>
<li><b>To:</b> <TWEETS_TO></li>
<li><b>Number of analyzed tweets:</b> <TWEETS_NUMBER></li>
<li><b>Tweets per week:</b> <TWEETS_PER_WEEK></li>
<li><b>Language:</b> <LANGUAGE></li>
<li><b>Geographical location:</b> <NEAR> <WITHIN> </li>

<h1>Results</h1><h3>Sentiment </h3></hr>After downloading <TWEETS_NUMBER> tweets between the specified dates, sentiment analysis has been executed on each and every one of those tweets. Sentiment score has been then <b>aggregated over weeks and months</b>, to lower the granularity of results on the time axis and then <b>plotted as a following linechart. </b>

<h3>Aggregation using heatmaps </h3></hr>
To show the general trend/pattern in the sentiment, linechart works great. We can see the bigger timeframe and estimate the long-term direction. But if you're interested in particular month or week, it's hard and in case of weeks actually impossible to see the change. Has an athlete put the great performance in particular match? Has the brand/company released a new line of product? So see such low lever changes, following 2 heatmaps are to be used.

<center>-------------------HEATMAP_MONTHLY---------------------------------------</center>
<center><sup>Chart shows average sentiment per month where <HEATMAP_MONTHLY_LOWEST> is the worst and <HEATMAP_MONTHLY_HIGHEST> the best achieved score</sup></center>

<center>-------------------HEATMAP_WEEKLY---------------------------------------</center>
<center><sup>Chart shows average sentiment per week where <HEATMAP_WEEKLY_LOWEST> is the worst and <HEATMAP_WEEKLY_HIGHEST> the best achieved score</sup></center>

<h3>Most frequently used words</h3><hr/>Another very interesting aspect to look into are the repeatedly used words using wordclouds. Even more interesting is to compare two wordclouds generated from different time - usually before and after some event/change happened. If you give this a second though, the problem here is that many short words (like <i>"and", "or", "with"</i> and so on) are used almost in every sentence and would also show up in wordclouds. To mitigate this, I've removed list of 153 so called <a href="https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/generated/wordcloud.WordCloud.html">stopwords</a>. Additionally I've also removed words typical for this area listed in the end of the report*.

<h3>Most frequently used UNIQUE words</h3>As we can see in the previous worldcloud, there are many words which are actually shared in both wordclouds. That makes all the sense as there are many areas which will be forever connected with <KEYWORD>. But I went one step further and decided to create wordclouds which contain only unique words with don't appear in the opposite wordcloud.

<center>-------------------WORDCLOUD-UNIQUE---------------------------------------</center>
<center><sup>Most often UNIQUE used words in tweets containing word <b>"<KEYWORD>"</b> before and after <BORDER_DATE>.</sup></center>

<i>* words excluded from all 4 wordclouds are: <EXCLUDED_WORDS_LIST></i>

<h3>BONUS - shaped wordcloud from all words!</h3>This one is just for fun :) It's generated from 1000 most popular words in all tweets, not divided into <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> groups. Click it to open!
